HEALTH TIPS FOR MEN:

It is very interesting that our health and our ability to live longer is not just a result of our luck or our genes. According to the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other leading institutions, diseases such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and suicide are the leading causes of deaths among men. 


1. Vary your workouts. The body gets very comfortable when you always do the same workout. You have got to keep varying your exercises, and they have to be an age-appropriate mix of aerobics, muscle training, and stretching.

2. Eat to thrive. Getting enough nutrition is crucial. Focus on nutrients rather than calories, and eat a variety of healthy foods. You can’t achieve optimum nutrition with limited choices.
3. Prioritize sleep. Get at least 7 hours. That’s not something you should compromise. Men think they can overcome sleep deprivation by exercising or whatever
4. Check your head. Mental health is really, really important. Think about several things: Are you drinking too much? Are you paying attention to signs of depression or bipolar disorder, which often get missed? If you have a family history of mental illness, suicide, and/or substance abuse, you really need someone to help you review the signs and symptoms."
 5. Care for your prostate. "The prostate grows as you get older. You’ll almost certainly have symptoms, like urinary problems. A really healthy, low-fat diet will reduce the likelihood of prostate growth and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer."

6. Enjoy yourself. "Look forward to every day, to doing something for yourself every day, whether it’s a run or listening to an audiobook or practicing meditation or yoga. Don’t save up all of your fun for vacation."
