FITNESS TIPS FOR KIDS

Exercise helps kids achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. Regular physical activity helps build and maintain strong, healthy muscles, bones and joints. Exercise aids in the development of important interpersonal skills—this is especially true for participation in team sports.

• Make physical activity part of the daily routine. From household chores to an after-dinner walk, keep your family active every day.

• Allow enough time for free play. Kids can burn more calories and have more fun when left to their own devices. Playing tag, riding bikes around the neighborhood, and building snowmen are fun and healthy.

• Keep a variety of games and sports equipment on hand. It doesn't have to be expensive — an assortment of balls, hula-hoops, and jump ropes can keep kids busy for hours.

• Be active together. It'll get you moving, and kids love to play with their parents.

• Limit time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching TV, being online, and playing video games and games apps.
